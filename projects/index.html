                        <p>This project tackles a critical and notoriously difficult problem in time-series analysis: learning true causal structures when data is measured much slower than the true underlying process (i.e., "undersampling"). This mismatch is common in fields like neuroscience—where fMRI scans are far slower than neural activity—and leads to standard causal learning methods producing misleading results.</p>
                        
                        <p>The core innovation of this work is a new algorithm, <strong>sRASL (Solver-based Rate-Agnostic Structure Learning)</strong>, which finds the true, fast-timescale causal graph without knowing the undersampling rate. This was achieved by skillfully reformulating the (NP-complete) search problem into a highly efficient constraint satisfaction problem. This approach demonstrates a strong command of Answer Set Programming (ASP), a sophisticated declarative logic framework used to solve complex combinatorial problems.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>The project's mathematical rigor is showcased in two key areas:</strong></p>
                        <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                            <li><strong>Novel Constraints:</strong> The algorithm's speed does not come from a simple translation to ASP. It integrates novel theoretical insights, introducing new constraints based on the graph-theoretic properties of Strongly Connected Components (SCCs). This innovation prunes the search space exponentially, enabling massive performance gains.</li>
                            <li><strong>Formal Guarantees:</strong> The method was formally proven to be correct and complete by showing it is a "direct encoding" of the undersampling problem, guaranteeing it finds the entire set of valid solutions.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>Finally, the algorithm includes a robust optimization mode that handles real-world statistical noise, allowing it to find the 'closest' valid causal graph even when the input data is imperfect.</p>

                        <p>This research challenges a fundamental assumption in data-driven science. The common belief is that to improve causal discovery, one must always measure a system faster. Our innovation was to formally prove this is incorrect: we show that new information can be gained by deliberately adding a slower measurement. This counter-intuitive <strong>"non-monotonic undersampling"</strong> phenomenon works because the slower timescale provides a different "perspective" on the system, helping to eliminate "causal illusions" (ambiguities) that exist at a single timescale.</p>
                        
                        <p>To operationalize this discovery, this project introduced the <strong>dRASL algorithm</strong>. This demonstrates advanced skills in Answer Set Programming (ASP), as dRASL is a novel generalization of our previous sRASL solver. Instead of just solving for one observed graph, dRASL is designed to find the joint equivalence class of causal structures consistent with multiple graphs from different timescales (e.g., H<sub>u</sub> and H<sub>v</sub>).</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>The mathematical rigor of this work is grounded in the formal conditions for non-monotonicity.</strong> We performed extensive computational experiments to validate the theory. The key results are:</p>
                        <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                            <li><strong>It Works:</strong> We proved the phenomenon exists. In one example, adding a slower graph (G<sub>5</sub>) to an existing one (G<sub>4</sub>) reduced the equivalence class (the number of possible solutions) from 11 graphs to 3.</li>
                            <li><strong>It's Common:</strong> This benefit is not a rare edge case. We found it occurs most frequently in sparse causal graphs—a property that aligns with the density of many real-world systems, such as brain or social networks.</li>
                            <li><strong>It's Powerful:</strong> The "gain" from this method is significant, commonly reducing the solution space by 1-2 orders of magnitude (10x-100x), with some cases showing a 1000-fold reduction.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>This research provides a new, low-cost path for improving causal discovery and shows that historical, slower-timescale data can be reused to gain new insights.</p>

                            <p class="figure-caption">This figure demonstrates how adding a slower measurement can paradoxically reduce uncertainty about a system's true causal structure. Panel (A) shows a single, "true" causal graph (G<sup>1</sup>) on the far left. The subsequent graphs (G<sup>2</sup> through G<sup>6</sup>) show the "illusory" and increasingly complex structures that are observed when measuring that same system at progressively slower rates. Black arrows represent causal links, while orange arrows represent correlations. Panel (B) shows the "equivalence class" for G<sup>4</sup>. If a scientist only observed G<sup>4</sup>, they wouldn't know the true structure; it could be any of these 11 possible graphs. Panel (C) shows the "joint equivalence class" for G<sup>4</sup> and G<sup>5</sup>. By using information from both the G<sup>4</sup> measurement and the even slower G<sup>5</sup> measurement, we can eliminate solutions that aren't compatible with both. The key result is the reduction in ambiguity: the set of possible true graphs drops from 11 (in B) to just 3 (in C). This demonstrates a clear information "gain" from deliberately adding a slower measurement.</p>

                            <p class="figure-caption">This figure illustrates why adding a slower measurement can be beneficial. (a) Monotonic Undersampling: This shows the standard intuition. The set of possible "true" graphs for a fast measurement (G<sup>5</sup>, orange) is fully contained within the set for a slower measurement (G<sup>6</sup>, blue). Combining them gives no new information. (b) Non-Monotonic Undersampling: This is the paper's key finding. The set of possible graphs for the fast measurement (H<sup>5</sup>, orange) and the slow measurement (H<sup>6</sup>, blue) only partially overlap. By finding the graphs that are consistent with both (the green intersection), we get a smaller, more refined set of solutions than either measurement could provide alone.</p>

                            <p class="figure-caption">This figure answers the crucial question: "When is adding a slower measurement actually useful?" The charts map the properties of thousands of simulated "true" causal graphs, comparing their density (sparse-to-dense, on the x-axis) to their temporal complexity (how many "illusory" graphs they produce, on the y-axis). Left Panel (a): Shows the general distribution of all simulated graphs. Middle Panel (b): Isolates only the special graphs where adding a slower measurement successfully reduced ambiguity. Right Panel (c): This panel directly shows the difference and reveals the key insight. The "gain" (the red area) is not randomly scattered; it is systematically concentrated in sparse, low-density graphs (density ~0.2-0.4). The big-picture takeaway: This benefit is not just a theoretical curiosity. It is most effective for the exact types of sparse networks that scientists frequently study in the real world, such as brain or social networks.</p>

                            <p class="figure-caption">This figure quantifies the practical payoff of deliberately adding a slower measurement. The Y-axis measures the "information gain" on a logarithmic scale. A value of 2 means the number of possible "true" graphs is reduced 100-fold, and a value of 4 means a 10,000-fold reduction. Left Panel (The "True" System): This shows when the method works best. The highest gains (dark red spots) are overwhelmingly found when the true, underlying causal system is sparse (low density, ~0.1-0.25). Right Panel (The "Observed" System): This is the key insight for a scientist. It shows that even when your measured graph looks dense and complex (high density, ~0.7-0.8), it is very likely one of those sparse systems where this method provides a massive, exponential gain in understanding. The big picture: The benefit isn't small. For the right kind of problem—a sparse system that looks complex—adding a single, slower measurement can dramatically shrink the "search space" of possible explanations.</p>

                        <p>This project introduces ION-C, a computationally efficient algorithm that builds a single, unified causal model from separate, partially overlapping datasets. We solved a major scalability problem with the original "ION" algorithm, which was unusable on graphs with more than 6 nodes</p>
                        <p>Our key achievement was reformulating the problem using Answer Set Programming (ASP), creating a new method that is provably sound and complete. We successfully scaled this new algorithm to graphs with up to 25 nodes.</p>
                        <p> Simulation results showed extremely high accuracy: causal links that appeared in ≥90% of solutions were 99.55% accurate to the ground truth. We also demonstrated a real-world application on European Social Survey data, where ION-C successfully identified a plausible causal connection between two variables that were never measured together in the same survey.</p>
