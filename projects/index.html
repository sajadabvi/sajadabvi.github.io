                        <p>This project tackles a critical and notoriously difficult problem in time-series analysis: learning true causal structures when data is measured much slower than the true underlying process (i.e., "undersampling"). This mismatch is common in fields like neuroscience—where fMRI scans are far slower than neural activity—and leads to standard causal learning methods producing misleading results.</p>
                        
                        <p>The core innovation of this work is a new algorithm, <strong>sRASL (Solver-based Rate-Agnostic Structure Learning)</strong>, which finds the true, fast-timescale causal graph without knowing the undersampling rate. This was achieved by skillfully reformulating the (NP-complete) search problem into a highly efficient constraint satisfaction problem. This approach demonstrates a strong command of Answer Set Programming (ASP), a sophisticated declarative logic framework used to solve complex combinatorial problems.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>The project's mathematical rigor is showcased in two key areas:</strong></p>
                        <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                            <li><strong>Novel Constraints:</strong> The algorithm's speed does not come from a simple translation to ASP. It integrates novel theoretical insights, introducing new constraints based on the graph-theoretic properties of Strongly Connected Components (SCCs). This innovation prunes the search space exponentially, enabling massive performance gains.</li>
                            <li><strong>Formal Guarantees:</strong> The method was formally proven to be correct and complete by showing it is a "direct encoding" of the undersampling problem, guaranteeing it finds the entire set of valid solutions.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>Finally, the algorithm includes a robust optimization mode that handles real-world statistical noise, allowing it to find the 'closest' valid causal graph even when the input data is imperfect.</p>

                        <p>This research challenges a fundamental assumption in data-driven science. The common belief is that to improve causal discovery, one must always measure a system faster. Our innovation was to formally prove this is incorrect: we show that new information can be gained by deliberately adding a slower measurement. This counter-intuitive <strong>"non-monotonic undersampling"</strong> phenomenon works because the slower timescale provides a different "perspective" on the system, helping to eliminate "causal illusions" (ambiguities) that exist at a single timescale.</p>
                        
                        <p>To operationalize this discovery, this project introduced the <strong>dRASL algorithm</strong>. This demonstrates advanced skills in Answer Set Programming (ASP), as dRASL is a novel generalization of our previous sRASL solver. Instead of just solving for one observed graph, dRASL is designed to find the joint equivalence class of causal structures consistent with multiple graphs from different timescales (e.g., H<sub>u</sub> and H<sub>v</sub>).</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>The mathematical rigor of this work is grounded in the formal conditions for non-monotonicity.</strong> We performed extensive computational experiments to validate the theory. The key results are:</p>
                        <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                            <li><strong>It Works:</strong> We proved the phenomenon exists. In one example, adding a slower graph (G<sub>5</sub>) to an existing one (G<sub>4</sub>) reduced the equivalence class (the number of possible solutions) from 11 graphs to 3.</li>
                            <li><strong>It's Common:</strong> This benefit is not a rare edge case. We found it occurs most frequently in sparse causal graphs—a property that aligns with the density of many real-world systems, such as brain or social networks.</li>
                            <li><strong>It's Powerful:</strong> The "gain" from this method is significant, commonly reducing the solution space by 1-2 orders of magnitude (10x-100x), with some cases showing a 1000-fold reduction.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>This research provides a new, low-cost path for improving causal discovery and shows that historical, slower-timescale data can be reused to gain new insights.</p>

                            <p class="figure-caption">This figure illustrates why adding a slower measurement can be beneficial. (a) Monotonic Undersampling: This shows the standard intuition. The set of possible "true" graphs for a fast measurement (G<sup>5</sup>, orange) is fully contained within the set for a slower measurement (G<sup>6</sup>, blue). Combining them gives no new information. (b) Non-Monotonic Undersampling: This is the paper's key finding. The set of possible graphs for the fast measurement (H<sup>5</sup>, orange) and the slow measurement (H<sup>6</sup>, blue) only partially overlap. By finding the graphs that are consistent with both (the green intersection), we get a smaller, more refined set of solutions than either measurement could provide alone.</p>

                            <p class="figure-caption">This figure answers the crucial question: "When is adding a slower measurement actually useful?" The charts map the properties of thousands of simulated "true" causal graphs, comparing their density (sparse-to-dense, on the x-axis) to their temporal complexity (how many "illusory" graphs they produce, on the y-axis). Left Panel (a): Shows the general distribution of all simulated graphs. Middle Panel (b): Isolates only the special graphs where adding a slower measurement successfully reduced ambiguity. Right Panel (c): This panel directly shows the difference and reveals the key insight. The "gain" (the red area) is not randomly scattered; it is systematically concentrated in sparse, low-density graphs (density ~0.2-0.4). The big-picture takeaway: This benefit is not just a theoretical curiosity. It is most effective for the exact types of sparse networks that scientists frequently study in the real world, such as brain or social networks.</p>

                            <p class="figure-caption">This figure quantifies the practical payoff of deliberately adding a slower measurement. The Y-axis measures the "information gain" on a logarithmic scale. A value of 2 means the number of possible "true" graphs is reduced 100-fold, and a value of 4 means a 10,000-fold reduction. Left Panel (The "True" System): This shows when the method works best. The highest gains (dark red spots) are overwhelmingly found when the true, underlying causal system is sparse (low density, ~0.1-0.25). Right Panel (The "Observed" System): This is the key insight for a scientist. It shows that even when your measured graph looks dense and complex (high density, ~0.7-0.8), it is very likely one of those sparse systems where this method provides a massive, exponential gain in understanding. The big picture: The benefit isn't small. For the right kind of problem—a sparse system that looks complex—adding a single, slower measurement can dramatically shrink the "search space" of possible explanations.</p>

                        <p>This project tackles a major bottleneck in modern deep learning: the extreme computational cost of finding optimal data augmentation policies. While AutoAugment proved that learning policies from data leads to state-of-the-art results, its reliance on a complex Reinforcement Learning (RL) controller to search an exponential search space makes it impractically expensive. This forces most researchers to re-use pre-trained policies on new datasets, which, as this paper shows, can actually hurt performance.</p>
                        
                        <p>Our <strong>Greedy AutoAugment (GAutoAugment)</strong> is an innovative solution that replaces this "black-box" RL approach with a highly efficient, transparent, and more effective search algorithm.

                        <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                            <li><strong>Algorithmic Redesign:</strong> We replaced the slow RL controller with a Greedy Breadth-First Search. The algorithm iteratively builds policies, starting with a single augmentation (layer 1) and evaluating all combinations. It then greedily selects the best-performing policy from that layer to serve as the base for the next layer of the search.</li>
                            <li><strong>Search Space Transformation:</strong> The key mathematical insight was to decouple the search variables. Instead of searching for (technique, probability, and magnitude) simultaneously, we fixed the probability to 1 during the search. This single design choice, combined with the greedy search, fundamentally changed the computational complexity from an exponential growth (O(N<sup>l</sup>)) to a linear growth (O(N×k)).</li>
                            <li><strong>Statistical Re-weighting:</strong> After the highly efficient search identifies the best policies, we re-introduce probabilities in a statistically sound manner. We use a Pareto distribution to assign higher selection probabilities to the policies that achieved higher accuracy during the search. This ensures that better policies are used more often during the final model training.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p><strong>Key Results</strong></p>
                        <p>This algorithmic and mathematical rigor directly translated into superior performance.</p>

                            <li><strong>Massive Efficiency:</strong> GAutoAugment finds better policies while using 360 times fewer computational resources than the original AutoAugment.</li>
                            <li><strong>Superior Accuracy:</strong> By being efficient enough to find dataset-specific policies, GAutoAugment consistently improved accuracy across four datasets (Tiny ImageNet, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN) and 11 different neural network architectures.</li>
                            <li><strong>Solved Transferability:</strong> We demonstrated that transferring policies is sub-optimal. The "one-size-fits-all" AutoAugment policy decreased accuracy on Tiny ImageNet by 52% compared to manual augmentation, while our dataset-specific search increased accuracy by 25%.</li>

                        <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare systems faced two critical bottlenecks: a shortage of diagnostic tests and a shortage of expert radiologists to interpret CT scans. This project tackled both problems by developing a novel deep learning architecture, <strong>DECAPS (Detail-Oriented Capsule Networks)</strong>, designed to automate COVID-19 diagnosis from CT scans with superhuman accuracy, even when trained on scarce data.</p>
                        
                        <p>This work demonstrates advanced skills in algorithmic design, generative modeling, and deep learning theory. Our innovations were:</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Novel Architecture (DECAPS):</strong> We didn't just use a standard CNN. We built our solution on Capsule Networks to better model the part-whole spatial relationships in a CT scan. We fundamentally improved the architecture by introducing:</p>
                        <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                            <li><strong>Inverted Dynamic Routing (IDR):</strong> A new, top-down routing mechanism that forces lower-level capsules to compete for the attention of higher-level ones. This rigorously-designed algorithm proved more stable and was crucial for filtering out noise from non-descriptive regions of the lung.</li>
                            <li><strong>"Peekaboo" Training:</strong> A novel, self-guided training procedure. The model uses its own activation maps to identify a region of interest (ROI). It then crops the ROI to force the network to learn fine-grained details, and drops (removes) the ROI to force the network to find all relevant disease features, not just the most obvious one.</li>
                            <li><strong>Generative Data Augmentation:</strong> To solve the critical "data scarcity" problem, we employed conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs). We used a pix2pix model to learn the distribution of COVID-19 features and generate hundreds of realistic, synthetic CT scan "deep fakes," which were vetted by our collaborating radiologists.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p><strong>Key Results</strong></p>
                        <p>Our approach was a resounding success, demonstrating a clear path to augmenting clinical experts.</p>
                        <ul style="margin-left: 2rem;">
                            <li><strong>State-of-the-Art Performance:</strong> The final DECAPS model achieved 96.1% AUC, significantly outperforming standard, powerful architectures like ResNet50, Inception-v3, and DenseNet121.</li>
                            <li><strong>Superhuman Accuracy:</strong> The model was benchmarked against three experienced, well-trained thoracic radiologists. On a high-quality, curated test set, DECAPS significantly outperformed all three human experts, achieving 98% AUC.</li>
                            <li><strong>Interpretable & Collaborative:</strong> The model generates Head Activation Maps (HAMs) to visualize exactly what regions it used to make its diagnosis. The clinical utility was so high that in one case, a radiologist revised their initial diagnosis after seeing the features our AI had highlighted.</li>
